Semenya said in response to the ruling that the IAAF "have always targeted me specifically"
Fans urged Caster Semenya not to quit athletics after she posted a cryptic tweet following the loss of her appeal against regulations restricting testosterone levels in female runners.

Semenya will have to take medication to reduce her testosterone level if she is to continue competing at 800m.

The double Olympic champion, 28, posted picture on Twitter containing a quote hinting at retirement.

"Knowing when to walk away is wisdom. Being able to is courage," it read.

"Walking away with your head held high is dignity."

One person replied to Semenya's tweet saying "never give up" while another urged her to "fight until the end".
